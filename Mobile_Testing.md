## 💡 **1. What is Mobile App Testing?**  
Mobile app testing ensures that applications on mobile devices function correctly, are user-friendly, and meet performance, security, and compatibility standards.

---

## 🛠️ **2. Types of Mobile App Testing:**  
- **Functional Testing:** Validates features work as expected.  
- **Usability Testing:** Ensures a smooth user experience.  
- **Compatibility Testing:** Checks app behavior on different devices and OS versions.  
- **Performance Testing:** Measures speed, stability, and responsiveness.  
- **Security Testing:** Protects against vulnerabilities.  
- **Interrupt Testing:** Verifies app behavior under interruptions (e.g., calls, notifications).  

---

## ⚙️ **3. Tools for Mobile Test Automation:**  
- **Appium:** Cross-platform mobile automation tool (JavaScript, WebDriver).  
- **Detox:** End-to-end testing framework for React Native apps.  
- **Espresso:** Android UI testing framework (Java/Kotlin).  
- **XCUITest:** iOS UI testing framework (Swift/Objective-C).  
- **BrowserStack:** Cloud platform for real-device testing.

# 💻 **Examples of Mobile App Tests Using JavaScript:**

### 🧪 **Example 1: Automating Login with Appium (JavaScript)**
**Scenario:** Test login functionality on an Android app.

```javascript
const wdio = require('webdriverio');

const opts = {
  path: '/wd/hub',
  port: 4723,
  capabilities: {
    platformName: 'Android',
    deviceName: 'emulator-5554',
    app: '/path/to/app.apk',
    automationName: 'UiAutomator2'
  }
};

(async () => {
  const driver = await wdio.remote(opts);

  const username = await driver.$('id=username');
  await username.setValue('testuser');

  const password = await driver.$('id=password');
  await password.setValue('password123');

  const loginButton = await driver.$('id=loginButton');
  await loginButton.click();

  const dashboard = await driver.$('id=dashboard');
  const isVisible = await dashboard.isDisplayed();
  
  console.log('Dashboard visible:', isVisible);
  await driver.deleteSession();
})();
```

---

### 💥 **Example 2: Handling Permissions in Appium (JavaScript)**
**Scenario:** Test if the app requests and handles location permissions correctly.

```javascript
const driver = await wdio.remote(opts);

// Grant location permission
await driver.execute('mobile: shell', {
  command: 'pm grant com.example.app android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION'
});

// Validate permission dialog
const locationDialog = await driver.$('id=permissionDialog');
if (await locationDialog.isDisplayed()) {
  const allowButton = await driver.$('id=allowButton');
  await allowButton.click();
}

console.log('Location permission handled.');
```

---

### 🧪 **Example 3: Push Notification Testing with Appium**
**Scenario:** Test how the app responds to push notifications.

```javascript
// Simulate push notification
await driver.execute('mobile: pushNotification', {
  bundleId: 'com.example.app',
  alert: {
    title: 'Test Notification',
    body: 'Hello from the test!'
  }
});

// Validate notification response
const notification = await driver.$('id=notification');
const isDisplayed = await notification.isDisplayed();
console.log('Notification displayed:', isDisplayed);
```

# 🧠 **Answers to Key Mobile App Testing Interview Questions:**

### **1. Difference Between Simulators and Emulators:**
| Aspect           | Simulator                      | Emulator                         |
|------------------|------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| **Definition**    | Imitates the software environment of a device. | Mimics both hardware and software of a device. |
| **Performance**   | Faster but less accurate.   | Slower but more accurate.       |
| **Use Case**      | Suitable for UI and quick functionality tests. | Suitable for performance and hardware-related tests. |
| **Platform**      | Primarily for iOS (Xcode Simulator). | Mainly for Android (Android Emulator). |
