# QA-Interview-Prep 🎯  

## Want to prepare for a QA interview?  

Well, you’ve come to the right place! Here, you’ll find **everything you need** to become an unstoppable QA machine. And no, you don’t need superpowers—just a willingness to learn (and a lot of coffee).  

This repository is a **friendly guide** for those preparing for Quality Assurance (QA) interviews. Don’t worry, you won’t find cryptic tech jargon here—just clear explanations, real-life examples, and a touch of humor to keep things interesting.  

We’ve compiled the most common questions you might face in a QA interview and organized them into different sections because we know QA is not just “clicking buttons and hoping for the best” (though, let’s be honest, sometimes it feels like it).

## 🚀 What’s Inside?  

📌 **Software Testing Fundamentals** - Because before you run, you need to crawl.  
📌 **Test Strategies & Planning** - We don’t want you testing things randomly like picking a restaurant at dinner time.  
📌 **API & Web Services Testing** - Ever typed `curl` in a terminal and felt like you were hacking the Pentagon? Well, here you’ll learn how to do it properly.  
📌 **Performance & Load Testing** - Because nobody wants an app that crashes with five concurrent users.  
📌 **Security Testing** - Avoid letting hackers turn your app into a data revolving door.  
📌 **Test Automation** - For when you’re tired of clicking buttons and decide to let a robot do the work.  
📌 **Mobile App Testing** - Because "it works on my machine" is not a valid excuse when users have a 2016 Android phone.  
📌 **Testing in Data & Scalability Environments** - Yes, data can break things.  
📌 **Agile & DevOps Testing** - Scrum, Kanban, DevOps? Learn how to stay sane in these environments.  
📌 **AI’s Impact on Testing** - Because now even AI wants to do our jobs.  

🎯 **BONUS:** A special section where testers can share real-life challenges they faced and how they solved them. We’ve all had that one bug that made us question life.
