# QA-Interview-Prep 🎯  

## Want to prepare for a QA interview?  

Well, you’ve come to the right place! Here, you’ll find **everything you need** to become an unstoppable QA machine. And no, you don’t need superpowers—just a willingness to learn (and a lot of coffee).  

This repository is a **friendly guide** for those preparing for Quality Assurance (QA) interviews. Don’t worry, you won’t find cryptic tech jargon here—just clear explanations, real-life examples, and a touch of humor to keep things interesting.  

We’ve compiled the most common questions you might face in a QA interview and organized them into different sections because we know QA is not just “clicking buttons and hoping for the best” (though, let’s be honest, sometimes it feels like it).

## 🚀 What’s Inside?  

1️⃣ [Software Testing Fundamentals](./Fundamentals.md) - Because before you run, you need to crawl.  
2️⃣ [Test Strategies & Planning](./Test_Strategies.md)  - We don’t want you testing things randomly like picking a restaurant at dinner time.  
3️⃣ [API & Web Services Testing](./API_Testing.md) - Ever typed `curl` in a terminal and felt like you were hacking the Pentagon? Well, here you’ll learn how to do it properly.  
4️⃣ [Performance & Load Testing](./Performance_Testing.md)  - Because nobody wants an app that crashes with five concurrent users.  
5️⃣ [Security Testing](./Security_Testing.md) - Avoid letting hackers turn your app into a data revolving door.  
6️⃣ [Test Automation](./Test_Automation.md)  - For when you’re tired of clicking buttons and decide to let a robot do the work.  
7️⃣ [Mobile App Testing](./Mobile_Testing.md)  - Because "it works on my machine" is not a valid excuse when users have a 2016 Android phone.  
8️⃣ [Testing in Data & Scalability Environments](./Data_Scalability_Testing.md) - (TODO) Yes, data can break things.  
9️⃣ [Agile & DevOps Testing](./Agile_DevOps_Testing.md)  - (TODO) Scrum, Kanban, DevOps? Learn how to stay sane in these environments.  
🔟 [AI’s Impact on Testing](./AI_Testing.md)  - Because now even AI wants to do our jobs.  
💡 [Community Challenges & Solutions](./Challenges.md)  
🎯 **BONUS:** A special section where testers can share real-life challenges they faced and how they solved them. We’ve all had that one bug that made us question life.
